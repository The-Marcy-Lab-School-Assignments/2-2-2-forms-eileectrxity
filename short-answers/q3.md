# Question 3
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer
The default behaviors of each of these buttons, when clicked, are as follows:

`<button>`:
With no type specified, a button element by itself acts as a submit button. If placed within a `<form>` element, clicking it will trigger the form submission process, sending form data to the server and refreshing the page.

`<button type="submit">`:
Submits the form it is associated with. If there is no form, clicking the button has no effect.

`<button type="reset">`:
Resets all the form fields to their default values. This action is the same as calling `form.reset()` programmatically. If there is no form, no action will be performed.

`<button type="button">`:
No default behavior. This type is used for buttons that need to perform custom actions defined by JavaScript, like capitalizing an input or changing the style of the page.
